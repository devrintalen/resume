\section*{Education}
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
2004--2008&{\bf Cornell University, College of Engineering, Ithaca, NY}\\
&Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering\\
&GPA: 3.2, Dean's List Fall 2004, Spring 2007\vspace{5pt}\\
2000--2004&Walt Whitman High School\\
&Honor Roll, National Merit Scholar\\
\end{tabular}

\section*{Experience}
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
2008--Present&{\bf Component Design Engineer, Intel Corporation, Hudson, MA}\\
&Developing and executing post-silicon test content to validate upcoming Itanium processors systems. Responsibilities include developing test plans, developing Random Content Generator (RCG) tools, debugging and root-causing silicon bugs, and pre-silicon RTL validation.\\
2007&{\bf Co-op, Intel Corporation, Hudson, MA}\\
&Developed a tool to analyze the fault coverage contribution of sROSL sites on Tukwila, an Itanium processor. Data generated by the tool impacted design decisions made by the implementation team. Other uses of the tool include: grading the effectiveness of functional tests; and identifying replacement tests for failing sROSL sites.\\
2006&{\bf Co-op, Intel Corporation, Hudson, MA}\\
&Worked with the test technology team to deliver testable content for Tukwila, an Itanium processor. Created tests that increased fault coverage.\\
\end{tabular}

\section*{Independent Work}
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
2009--2012&{\bf ADBUSB}\\
&USB adapter for the 1987 Apple Extended Keyboard. Translates Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) protocol into HID-compliant USB. Developed the entire project, from the microcontroller code, to the schematics, to the PCB layout.\\
2007&{\bf SIAM32: AVR USB 2.0 Host Controller}\\
&Implemented a fully-functioning USB 2.0-compliant host controller on an Atmel Mega32 microcontroller. Coded 5,000 lines, 1,000 of which were in AVR assembly. Collaborated with two other classmates to deliver the device in under a month.\\
\end{tabular}

\section*{Project Teams}
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
2006&{\bf Embedded System Developer, Cornell University Satellite Team}\\
&Programmed the interface boards connecting several modules to a backplane. Used both hardware and software solutions to provide a common communications interface to disparate units. Team competed in the University Nanosat-4 Program.\\
